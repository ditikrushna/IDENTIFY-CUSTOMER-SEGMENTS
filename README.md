### Overview 
In this project, Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions have provided two datasets one with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company. I have looked at relationships between demographics features, organized the population into clusters, and saw how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained. 

### Objective 
Apply **unsupervised learning techniques** on demographic and spending data for a sample of German households. Preprocess the data, apply **dimensionality reduction techniques**, and implement **clustering algorithms** to segment customers with the goal of optimizing customer outreach for a mail order company. 

### Motivation 
This project was completed as part of Udacity's [Data Scientist Nanodegree](https://eu.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) certification. 

### Data Overview 
The files used in the project:

-   `Udacity_AZDIAS_Subset.csv`  : Demographic data for the general population of Germany; 891211 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).
-   `Udacity_CUSTOMERS_Subset.csv`  : Demographic data for customers of a mail-order company; 191652 persons (rows) x 85 features (columns).
-   `Data_Dictionary.md`  : Information file about the features in the provided datasets.
-   `AZDIAS_Feature_Summary.csv`  : Summary of feature attributes for demographic data.
-   `Identify_Customer_Segments.ipynb`  : Jupyter Notebook divided into sections and guidelines for completing the project. The notebook provides more details and tips than the outline given here.
